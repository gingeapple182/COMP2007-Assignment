# The Floor is Lava ðŸŒ‹ðŸ”¥  

## Project Overview  
**The Floor is Lava** is a first-person platformer where you are trying to escape a factory after a volcano erruption causing it to fill with lava. Can you escape before it reaches you or will you be caught out when the floor becomes lava?  

## Gameplay Features  
- **First-Person Movement** â€“ Navigate the world using keyboard and mouse controls.  
- **Parkour Platforming** â€“ Jump from safe zones to avoid touching the lava.  
- **Collectibles & Progression** â€“ Find items to unlock doors and access new routes.  
- **Dynamic Environment** â€“  
  - Floating objects (pillows) may **sink over time**, making them temporary platforms.  
  - Some objects can be **moved** to create new safe routes.  
- **Power-ups** â€“ Pick up temporary buffs such as lavawalking and improved jumping.  

## Development Details  
- **Engine:** Unity  
- **Camera Perspective:** First-Person  
- **3D Models:** Created using Probuilder and/or Unity Store.

- **Audio & Music:** Free resources (credited in this README).  

## Planned Features (Stretch Goals)  
- Lava dynamically rising and falling.
