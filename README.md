# The Floor is Lava ðŸŒ‹ðŸ”¥  

## Project Overview  
**The Floor is Lava** is a first-person platformer where you play as a kid trying to reach safety while avoiding the deadly lava covering the floor. You must carefully navigate the environment, jumping between safe zones and collecting keys to unlock new areas. The game introduces interactive elements like temporary floating objects and movable obstacles.  

## Gameplay Features  
- **First-Person Movement** â€“ Navigate the world using keyboard and mouse controls.  
- **Parkour Platforming** â€“ Jump from safe zones to avoid touching the lava.  
- **Collectibles & Progression** â€“ Find items to unlock doors and access new routes.  
- **Dynamic Environment** â€“  
  - Floating objects (pillows) may **sink over time**, making them temporary platforms.  
  - Some objects can be **moved** to create new safe routes.  
- **Power-ups** â€“ Pick up temporary buffs such as lavawalking and improved jumping.
